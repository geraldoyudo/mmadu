== Overview

Mmadu Registration Service is an independent service for managing user flows.

For now, only user registration flow is supported.

It exposes the following resources for handling dynamic generation of registration forms:

. Domain Registration Profile - Handles registration service configuration for the domain
. Field Types - Global field types supported by the registration service
. Field - Domain Fields supported by a domain

== Features

Currently, mmadu user service provides the following:

. Resource Management - Management of registration profiles, fields, and field types.
. Registration - Provides a dynamic registration form to register users.

== Default Configuration

=== Default Port

Mmadu Registration Service listens to port 15552 by default and this can be configured using the SERVER_PORT environment variable
or the server.port SpringBoot property.

== Setting Up A Domain

A domain can be initialized for handling user registration by making a `POST /domains` call with the required
fields and profile configuration needed to form your registration page.

Authority: `domain_flow.initialize`

NOTE: This api is only used for initial domain setup.

=== Domain Setup Request Fields

include::{snippets}/batch-domain-flow-initialization-documentation/batch-create-domains/1/request-fields.adoc[]

This api first creates the field types, and then the domain registration profile and fields. Any field type or domain
that exists previously will be ignored.

=== Domain Setup Response

The api responds with a `HTTP 201 CREATED` response.


== User Registration

The registration service provides an api to access the registration page for a domain. The registration service
generates a form from the configured fields and field types of a domain.

=== Displaying the registration form

The registration form can be accessed in the browser using the url:

----
http://[registration-host]:[registration-port]/[domain-id]/register
----

For example, accessing the default domain with the default configuration can be done
by entering the url below on your browser.

----
http://localhost:15552/0/register
----

The registration services redirects to the defaultRedirectionUrl specified in the registration profile for
this domain. To specify a url to redirect to, add the redirectUrl parameter.

----
http://localhost:1552/0/register?redirectUrl=http://myapp.com
----


== Customizing Registration Forms

Registration forms for a domain can be customized by adding and removing fields and field types.
The registration service ensures that form fields are created for each field.


== Registration Profiles

Each domain has a registration profile object that is used for configuring the applications behaviour during
registration.

NOTE: There can be only one registration profile for a domain.

=== Creating a Registration Profile

A `POST /repo/registrationProfiles` Request will create a registration profile.

Field type objects specify the properties of a field type in the registration form. You can create a field type that
can be used by fields in a registration form. Field types are global and can be used by any domain.

== Managing Fields

Fields contain information used in rendering each field in a registration form. Fields utilize properties
of their field types in order to render an adequate representation of the field. Fields also specify the user property
that the input field is bound to. Fields can override and extend certain properties of the field types.

See <<defining-markup-for-fields, Defining Markup for fields>> for more information on how to customize fields.

[#defining-markup-for-fields]
=== Defining Markup for Fields

You define how you want your registration fields by configuring fields and field types. The markup property in
the field type is used to define the markup of that specific field type. An age field type markup can be defined
as shown:

[source,html]
----
<label for='$field.name' class='sr-only'>$field.label</label>
<input type='number' id='$field.name' name='$field.name' class='form-control'
placeholder='$field.placeholder' $maxValue $minValue autofocus $required $inputField $inputStyle $errorStyle >
$errorDisplay"
----

Mmadu registration service uses apache velocity to generate markup for fields. It provies the following in
the template context for use in defining fields. You reference context objects by adding the `$` prefix. For example,
the `$field.name` returns the name property in the field object.

|===
|Object Name |Description

|field
|The field object

|type
|The field type object

|inputField
|Input attribute and value that marks an element as a model input

|inputStyle
|style attribute, any element with this property will have the field type style property appended to that element

|errorStyle
|style attribute, any element with this property will have the style appended with the error style when the field contains errors

|errorDisplay
|HTML markup for displaying field errors

|maxValue
|max attribute, any element with this will have the max attribute set to the max value of the field type

|minValue
|min attribute, any element with this will have the min attribute set to the min value of the field type
