== Overview

Mmadu Registration Service is an independent service for managing user flows.

For now, only user registration flow is supported.

It exposes the following resources for handling dynamic generation of registration forms:

. Domain Registration Profile - Handles registration service configuration for the domain
. Field Types - Global field types supported by the registration service
. Field - Domain Fields supported by a domain

== Features

Currently, mmadu user service provides the following:

. Resource Management - Management of registration profiles, fields, and field types.
. Registration - Provides a dynamic registration form to register users.

== Default Configuration

=== Default Port

Mmadu Registration Service listens to port 15552 by default and this can be configured using the SERVER_PORT environment variable
or the server.port SpringBoot property.

== Setting Up A Domain

A domain can be initialized for handling user registration by making a `POST /domains` call with the required
fields and profile configuration needed to form your registration page.

Authority: `domain_flow.initialize`

NOTE: This api is only used for initial domain setup.

=== Domain Setup Request Fields

include::{snippets}/batch-domain-flow-initialization-documentation/batch-create-domains/1/request-fields.adoc[]

This api first creates the field types, and then the domain registration profile and fields. Any field type or domain
that exists previously will be ignored.

=== Domain Setup Response

The api responds with a `HTTP 201 CREATED` response.


== User Registration

The registration service provides an api to access the registration page for a domain. The registration service
generates a form from the configured fields and field types of a domain.

=== Displaying the registration form

The registration form can be accessed in the browser using the url:

----
http://[registration-host]:[registration-port]/[domain-id]/register/[registration-profile-code]
----

For example, accessing the default domain with the default configuration can be done
by entering the url below on your browser.

----
http://localhost:15552/0/register/user
----

The registration services redirects to the defaultRedirectionUrl specified in the registration profile for
this domain. To specify a url to redirect to, add the redirectUrl parameter. Here we are using a registration
profile with code `user`.

----
http://localhost:1552/0/register/user?redirectUrl=http://myapp.com
----


== Customizing Registration Forms

Registration forms for a domain can be customized by adding and removing fields and field types.
The registration service ensures that form fields are created for each field.

== Domain Flow Configurations

Each domain has a Domain Flow Configuration object that is used for configuring the applications behaviour during
registration.

== Managing Fields

Fields contain information used in rendering each field in a registration form. Fields utilize properties
of their field types in order to render an adequate representation of the field. Fields also specify the user property
that the input field is bound to. Fields can override and extend certain properties of the field types.

See <<defining-markup-for-fields, Defining Markup for fields>> for more information on how to customize fields.

[#defining-markup-for-fields]
=== Defining Markup for Fields

You define how you want your registration fields by configuring fields and field types. The markup property in
the field type is used to define the markup of that specific field type. An age field type markup can be defined
as shown:

[source,html]
----
<label for='$field.name' class='sr-only'>$field.label</label>
<input type='number' id='$field.name' name='$field.name' class='form-control'
placeholder='$field.placeholder' $maxValue $minValue autofocus $required $inputField $inputStyle $errorStyle >
$errorDisplay"
----

Mmadu registration service uses apache velocity to generate markup for fields. It provies the following in
the template context for use in defining fields. You reference context objects by adding the `$` prefix. For example,
the `$field.name` returns the name property in the field object.

|===
|Object Name |Description

|field
|The field object

|type
|The field type object

|inputField
|Input attribute and value that marks an element as a model input

|inputStyle
|style attribute, any element with this property will have the field type style property appended to that element

|errorStyle
|style attribute, any element with this property will have the style appended with the error style when the field contains errors

|errorDisplay
|HTML markup for displaying field errors

|maxValue
|max attribute, any element with this will have the max attribute set to the max value of the field type

|minValue
|min attribute, any element with this will have the min attribute set to the min value of the field type
|===

[#user-workflows]
=== User Workflows

Mmadu Registration provides workflows that manage the status of the users. The available workflows are as follows:

* User Registration
* Password Reset
* User Property Validation

==== User Registration

The registration service provides the ability to create multiple registration
profiles to configure different forms and behaviour for registering different types of users.
For example collecting email for admin users and phone number for regular users.

A registration profile enables you to set the default roles, authorities and groups a user
will have/belong to  when registered.

In addition to this, you can also configure the default account status of each user as soon as registration
is complete. The default Account status is a json object that specifies whether
the user's account is locked, enabled, active or expired upon registration. See <<_creating_a_registration_profile, Creating a Registration Profile>>
for more information on how to set default account status and other profile customizations.


==== Password Reset

The registration service also provides a flow for password reset and customization. The basic stebs are as follows:

. User clicks on the password reset link
. User enters his account identification (username, email, phone number or any other identifiable property).
. The service sends a notification if it finds only one account matching the identification. This notification
contains the password reset link.
. The user clicks on this password reset link in the notification received.
. The user is redirected to a reset page to enter a new password.
. The user enters a new password and clicks on submit.
. The user's password is changed.

The password reset flow is uses notifications to send reset links to the user. The client
can configure these to send an email, sms, or other notifications. The registration services
utilizes the notification service by default, but any other notification service can be configured
to work with the registration service by listening to amqp events fired by the registration service on
password reset initiation.

The password reset behaviour can be configured through the passwordReset property of the domain registration configuration.

===== Password Reset Initiation Event

A password reset initiation event is fired when an account has been found for password reset. Clients can listen for this event to
customize behaviour on password reset initiation.

An AMQP event is sent with the following details:

* Routing key: <domain-id>.user.password.reset.initiation
* Body: Json Object comprising of `id`, `domain`, `userId` and `resetLink` properties.

===== Password Reset Token

The registration service uses the otp service by default to generate password reset tokens. You can customize how
the token is generated by configuring the top token profile.


==== User Property Validation

The registration service uses tokens to validate user properties. It exposes apis for initiating
and attempting property validation. Together with the user service, the registration service functions to manage and
keep track of property validation states.

===== Property Validation Initiation

Authority: `validation.property.<property-name>.request`

A post request will initiate property validation for a user property.

====== Property Validation Initiation Request

[#property-validation-types]
===== Property Validation Types

Currently, the following property validation types are supported:

|===
|Property Validation Type |Description | Validation Request Data | Validation Attempt Data

|email
|User Email
|none
|`code`: OTP code sent via email

|sms
|Text Message for validation phone number
|none
|`code`: OTP code sent via sms
