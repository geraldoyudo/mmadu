== Overview

Mmadu User Service is an independent service for managing users. It exposes the following resources
for managing users:

. AppDomains - This is a tenant, with its own users, groups, roles and authorities.
. AppUsers - Representing users of client applications. Users can have custom properties defined by the domain.
. Roles and Authorities - Enforcable user privileges.
. Groups - Objects used to further categorize users in a tree hierarchy.

== Features

Currently, mmadu user service provides the following:

. Resource Management - Management of domains, users, roles, authorities and groups
. Authentication - Provides an api that clients can use to Authenticate their users.
. Password Hashing - Passwords of users are hashed and cannot be decrypted.

== Default Configuration

=== Default Port

Mmadu User Service listens to port 15551 by default and this can be configured using the SERVER_PORT environment variable
or the server.port SpringBoot property.

== Managing Domains

A domain is analogous to a realm. This represents a user pool with its own set of users, groups, roles, and authorities.

A client application references users in one domain. A domain is referenced by a domain id. Applications
can share the same user base by using the same domain id.

=== Setting Up A Domain

With one API call, you can set up users, roles, authorities and groups needed for your domain. Domain configuration is done
with a call to `POST /domains`.

NOTE: This api is only used for initial domain setup.

== Managing Groups

Users can be categorized into groups and groups can be a parent or a child of another group. This
makes is possible to create nested hierarchies of users.

For instance, to model an office application you can have a root group called `Staff` and other sub groups
like `cleaners`, `receptionists`, `managers`, `technicians` and so on. Under `managers`, you can have
`regional_managers` and `country_managers`.

In the hierarchy above, adding a user to the `country_managers` group means that the user is also in the `managers`
group and the `staff` group.

Removal of the user from the `country managers` group removes the user from all parent groups. You have to
explicitly add the user in the `staff` group if you want the user to remain in that group.

Groups can also be used to implement multi-tenant solutions. Group information is added to the jwt token so that services
can know which groups a user belongs.

=== Creating A Group

A 'POST /domains/{domainId}/groups' request will create a group.

Authority: `group.create`

==== Group Creation Request Body Fields

Roles are a way to batch authorities. When a role is mapped to some certain privileges/authorities, 
a user with that role automatically has those privileges.

exists will be updated. With this api, you can create multiple roles and initialize them
with their respective authorities. This is useful for initializing all the roles and authorities
